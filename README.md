\## Task 04 – Safe Input Logger (Educational Demonstration)



Objective:

This project demonstrates a safe and ethical version of a keystroke logging concept. The script only records text that the user types inside this program window and saves it to a local file. It does not run in the background and does not capture system-wide keystrokes.



Features:

\- Logs user input from the visible console

\- Saves data to keystrokes.log

\- Stops when the user types EXIT

\- Designed strictly for educational cybersecurity learning



How to Run:

python safe\_input\_logger.py



Sample Log Output (keystrokes.log):

\[2025-12-03T16:42:20] Hello team

\[2025-12-03T16:42:25] This is Adish

\[2025-12-03T16:42:29] Testing input logger



Ethical Note:

Keylogging can be abused to steal passwords or private information. This project intentionally avoids background monitoring or capturing other users' activity. It is meant only for responsible, educational use in a controlled environment.
